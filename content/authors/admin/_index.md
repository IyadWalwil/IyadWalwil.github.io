I am a research scientist at Sony AI in the Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning team lead by [https://sites.google.com/view/lingjuan-lyu/home Lingjuan Lyu].

My topics of research encompass 
- Federated Learning (especially personalized FL in presence of data, model and hardware heterogeneity)
- Edge AI
- Vision Foundation Models
- Computer Vision privacy ([https://ai.sony/blog/blog-035/ cf my blog post])
- Optimization for Machine Learning

I recently got into *Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) in the Federated Learning context* from both a theoretical in empirical point of view. Feel free to reach out if you want to collaborate!\n

As far as possible, I try to *code efficient and reproducible experiments* through tested open source codes.
I am contributing to the Python open source package *[https://github.com/facebookresearch/RidgeSketch RidgeSketch]* (developed with FAIR New York) about sketch-and-project methods for the ridge regression problem.
I also contributed to the Julia suite of stochastic optimization codes *[https://github.com/gowerrobert/StochOpt.jl StochOpt]* and briefly to *[https://github.com/benchopt/benchOpt BenchOpt]*\n\n
